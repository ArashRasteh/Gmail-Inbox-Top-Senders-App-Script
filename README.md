# Gmail-Inbox-Top-Senders-App-Script
A Google App Script for Gmail to see a list of the top senders within Gmail

Create a new project through https://script.google.com/

Once the code from the other files in this repo are copied over, click "Deploy" > "Test Deploy" > And Install it to Gmail. Then it should show up on the right side of Gmail on the Desktop. 

You will likely also see an authorization message the first time you do use it, and you need to authorize access to the script. It will also likely give you a warning that the source is unknown, but since it is from your own Apps Script you can ignore it if you are confident in what you are doing. Please do double check the code and don't accept if you don't know what you are doing.
